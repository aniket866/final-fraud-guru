[screen-capture (26).webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01c37c08-6cc1-4587-97fd-f2aae62ecda7)

## Project Overview

The **Fraud Detection System** leverages advanced AI models to detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions, e-commerce platforms, and online services. By utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques, this system enhances security and prevents financial losses.

## Technologies Used

### **AI Models**
- **XGBoost** - For high-performance fraud classification
- **Random Forest** - For robust fraud pattern detection
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** - For sequential transaction anomaly detection
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** - For NLP-based fraud detection in customer interactions
- **Autoencoders** - For unsupervised anomaly detection

### **Web Technologies**
- **Vite** - Fast frontend build tool
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **React** - User interface framework
- **shadcn-ui** - UI components for enhanced user experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling framework
- **FastAPI** - Backend API for AI model integration
- **PostgreSQL** - Database for storing transactions and fraud reports

## Features
- **Real-time Fraud Detection**: AI-driven algorithms analyze transactions in real time.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Identifies unusual spending or activity patterns.
- **Rule-based & AI Hybrid Detection**: Combines rule-based logic with AI predictions.
- **Transaction Monitoring Dashboard**: Visualizes transaction trends and anomalies.
- **Automated Alerts & Reporting**: Notifies users of potential fraud cases.
- **Explainability & Model Interpretability**: Provides insights into why a transaction was flagged.
